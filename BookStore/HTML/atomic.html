                No matter your goals, 
                <i>Atomic Habits</i> 
              
                <br><br>If you're having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn't you. 
                The problem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because 
                you don't want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change. You do not 
                rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems. Here, you'll get 
                a proven system that can take you to new heights.
                <br><br>Learn how to:<br>-&nbsp;Make time for new habits (even when life gets crazy);<br>-&nbsp;Overcome a lack 
                of motivation and willpower;<br>- Design your environment to make success easier;<br>- Get back on track when you fall off course;
                <br>...and much more.<br><br><i>Atomic Habits</i> will reshape the way you think about progress and success, and give you the tools 
                and strategies you need to transform your habits--whether you are a team looking to win a championship, an organization hoping to redefine 
                an industry, or simply an individual who wishes to quit smoking, lose weight, 
                reduce stress, or achieve any other goal.
