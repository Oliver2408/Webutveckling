                How to Win Friends and Influence People is a 1936 self-help book written by Dale Carnegie. Over 
                30 million copies have been sold worldwide, making it one of the best-selling books of all time.
                <br><br><br><i>Carnegie had been conducting business education courses in New York since 1912.
                    In 1934, Leon Shimkin, of the publishing firm Simon & Schuster, took one of Carnegie's 14-week courses on human relations 
                    and public speaking, and later persuaded Carnegie to let a stenographer take notes from the course to be revised for publication.
                    The initial five thousand copies of the book sold exceptionally well, going through 17 editions in its first year alone.</i>
